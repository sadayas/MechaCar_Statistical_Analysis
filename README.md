# MechaCar Statistical Analysis

## Overview
With the use of our resources, we will use the data to determine how the newest prototype, MechaCar, is developing.

## Results

### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1.  The varibles to provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg, are vehicle length, and its ground clearance.  These will have the most signifcant impact on the MPG.

2.  With the p-value at 5.35e-11, it is less than the predicted siginicant level of 50%, it slope is not zero.

3. Yes, it is a good linear model to predict the efficiently of the MechaCar's MPG.  With the r-squared value at over 70%, it is a better indicator when explaining and predicting the variables and MPG.

### Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
With the use of our summary, it shows that most of the lots meet the suspension coil requirements.  In our total summary table of the lots, it shows
